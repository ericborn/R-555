# R-555
This is all of the coursework I completed for CS 555 - Data Analysis and Visualization utilizing R. Topics covered were statistical
inference, confidence intervals, P-values, One- and Two-Sample Test of Means, Simple Linear Regression, fit of simple linear
regression models, Assumptions of linear regression and evaluation of these assumptions, Residuals and associated plots,
Multiple linear regression, One and two way tests for comparisons of means across 2 or more groups, Covariate Adjustment, Dummy
variables, Interaction, Multiple testing procedures, 1 and 2 Sample Test of Proportions, Logistic Regression and Receiver 
Operator Curves.

The final project was to identify a dataset, develop a reasearch scenario and question, then to formally test the question
or theory and provide a conclusion.
